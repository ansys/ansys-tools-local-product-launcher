        "text": "Currently, many PyAnsys libraries implement a launch function, which looks\nsomething like this:\nWhile this approach is reasonably simple to use, it has some disadvantages:\nIt can be difficult to tell from the keyword arguments how the server is launched.\nNon-standard launch parameters must always be passed along to the launch_myproduct()\nmethod. This makes examples that are generated on a continuous integration machine\nnon-tranferable. Users must replace the launch parameters with what is applicable to\ntheir setups.\nEach product implements the local launcher separately, with some accidental differences.\nThis limits code reuse.\nHere’s how the Local Product Launcher improves on the status quo:\nThe launch_mode() method is passed as an explicit argument, and all other configuration\nis collected into a single object. The available configuration options explicitly depend\non the launch mode.\nThe Local Product Launcher separates configuration from the launching code by default.\nTo still enable cases where multiple different configurations must be available at run time,\nthis separation is optional. The full configuration can still be passed to the launching code.\nThe Local Product Launcher provides a common interface for implementing the launching task\nand handles common tasks like ensuring that the product is closed when the Python process exits.\nIt doesn’t attempt to remove the inherent differences between launching different products.\nUltimately, control over the launch is with each specific PyAnsys library through a plugin\nsystem.\nImprovements over the status quo\nlaunch_myproduct()\nlaunch_mode()"

Because\nthere’s quite a lot going on in this code, descriptions of each part are provided.\nThe launcher class inherits from LauncherProtocol[LauncherConfig]. This isn’t a requirement, but it means a type checker like mypy can verify that the LauncherProtocol interface is fulfilled.\nNext, setting CONFIG_MODEL = DirectLauncherConfig connects the launcher to the configuration class.\nThe subsequent line, SERVER_SPEC = {\"main\": ServerType.GRPC}, defines which kind of servers the\nproduct starts. Here, there’s only a single server, which is accessible via gRPC. The keys in this\ndictionary can be chosen arbitrarily, but they should be consistent across the launcher implementation.\nIdeally, you use the key to convey some meaning. For example, \"main\" could refer to the main interface\nto your product and file_transfer could refer to an additional service for file upload and download.\nThe __init__ method must accept exactly one keyword-only argument, config, which contains the\nconfiguration instance. In this example, the configuration is stored in the _config attribute.\nFor the _url and _process attributes, only the type is declared for the benefits of the type checker\nThe core of the launcher implementation is in the start() and stop() methods:\nThis start() method selects an available port using the\nfind_free_ports() function. It then starts the server as a subprocess. Note that here, the server output is simply discarded. In a real launcher, the option to redirect it (for example to a file) should be added.\nThe _url attribute keeps track of the URL and port that the server should be accessible on.\nThe start() method terminates the subprocess:\nIf your product is prone to ignoring SIGTERM, you might want to add a timeout to the\n.wait() method and retry with the\n.kill() method instead of the\n.terminate() method.\nNext, you must provide a way to verify that the product has successfully launched. This is implemented\nin the check. Because the server implements gRPC health checking, the\ncheck_grpc_health() helper can be used for this purpose:\nFinally, the _url attribute stored in the start() method must\nbe made available in the urls property:\nNote that the return value for the urls property should adhere to the schema defined in SERVER_SPEC.\nDefine launcher\nLauncherProtocol[LauncherConfig]\nLauncherProtocol\nCONFIG_MODEL = DirectLauncherConfig\nSERVER_SPEC = {\"main\": ServerType.GRPC}\n\"main\"\nfile_transfer\n__init__\nconfig\n_config\n_url\n_process\nstart()\nstop()\nstart()\nfind_free_ports()\n_url\nstart()\nSIGTERM\n.wait()\n.kill()\n.terminate()\ncheck\ncheck_grpc_health()\n_url\nstart()\nurls\nurls\nSERVER_SPEC"
